# ` `**Final Report Rubric**
###


## **Overview**
The Final Report (thesis) represents the culmination of the Engineering Research project. It is the main vehicle by which the project will be judged and must clearly demonstrate the quality of the project, processes, and outcomes. It is important to note that the marker will not be the supervisor.  The report should be written with this in mind.

The marker(s) will be sent a Supervisor’s Report, which allows the supervisor to provide some commentary on the project, type, significance of the project outcomes, and any extenuating circumstances that may have impacted the project.  While the report is to be read in conjunction with the supervisor’s report, the report must be able to stand alone in reflecting the work achieved.

The project must have direct relevance to engineering and engineering practice. The project is classified as either a(n)

- Experimental project
- Modelling project
- Design (and build) project
- Engineering practice, techno-economic, or business-focused project
- Extended literature review

The Supervisor’s Report will identify the project type.  Students should check with their supervisor if they are unsure what category the project fits into.

## **Word Count**
The word limit for the report is 7000 words.  This is based on the main body of the report (Introduction to conclusions and future work).  It does not include appendices, reference list, content list, etc.  The word count must be stated on the title page of the report.  Note, the Turnitin word count includes the full document.

## **Marking**
- The Final Report **contributes 50%** to the final mark of the Engineering Research Project.
- The report will be marked using the attached rubric.  It is marked out of 100 and judged against four criteria:
  - Scope (marked out of 10)
  - Project Body (marked out of 70) 
  - Conclusions and Topics for Further Investigation (marked out of 10)
  - Presentation (marked out of 10)

A modified rubric for the Project Body is used for each project type.

## **Note to Markers**
- The Engineering Research Project is a 12-point project, which is equivalent to *300 hours of effort*.  The final report should be marked with this in mind. 
- The markers are asked to submit a raw mark (/100) and a paragraph or two of written feedback, with reference to the rubric.**  Students may request the feedback after unit marks are formally released. 
- The Final Report is a **Failed Component**.  Students must pass the report to pass the unit.






## **RUBRIC**

|<p><h3>**Scope**</h3></p><p>The scope is a measure of the relative contribution of the project. The scope will be judged based on the material presented in the report and should be encapsulated in the project summary (or abstract). An original contribution of significant breadth and depth will be required for high distinction.   </p>|<p><h3>**Mark**</h3></p><p><h3>**Range**</h3></p>|||
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|<p></p><p>/10</p>|N/N+|Very narrow project scope, little or no original contribution – in the absence of justification in the report or in the supervisor’s report. 0 = Project scope not defined|` `0 – 4.5|
||P|Project scope is adequate for a student internal report, not suitable for external presentation (Does not satisfy H2B requirements)|5 – 5.5|
